## Bag of Words

Machine learnig deals with Numerical or quantitative factors, so to be able to handle text-data we need to apply BAG OF WORDS rule to enable us convert the text-data into quantitative entities. so, to do this we assign (1,0) to the POSITIVE and NEGATIVE words in the sentences.

[This book is great] and [This book was so bad] = [this,book,is,great,was,so,bad] this are the words and the rule will be #[1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
